onizd is the server component of [ZTransport][1], a mod for Oxygen Not Included.

# Compiling

Install Rust, if you don't have it already. Installing Rust is pretty simple if you follow [these directions][2].

Clone this repository (or otherwise get the source code):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SolraBizna/onizd
```

[2]: https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

# Running

```sh
cd onizd
cargo run --release --
```

Any additional command line arguments you want go after the `--`. Pass `--help` to see a list of command line arguments.

Example:

```sh
cargo run --release -- -v -a ~/secret_photo.jpeg
```

This example will print some information every time something passes (or tries to pass) the Z barrier, many times per second. It will also require authentication, using `secret_photo.jpeg` as the shared secret. (NOTE: the current version of the client does not support authentication, and the way authentication works will change in the future!)
