# Windows Usage

If you're on Windows, all you need is to go straight to [the Releases page](https://github.com/SolraBizna/onizd/releases) and download a prebuilt, graphical Windows version.

# Other OSes (Linux, macOS...)

## Compiling

Install Rust, if you don't have it already. Installing Rust is pretty simple if you follow [these directions][2].

Clone this repository (or otherwise get the source code):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SolraBizna/onizd
```

## Running

If you want to run the GUI version:

```sh
cd onizd
cargo run --release --features gui
```

Chances are the GUI version is good enough for your needs. But, if you want the command line version instead:

```sh
cd onizd
cargo run --release --
```

Any additional command line arguments you want go after the `--`. Pass `--help` after the `--` to see a list of command line arguments.

Example:

```sh
cargo run --release -- -v
```

This example will print some information every time something passes (or tries to pass) the Z barrier, many times per second.
